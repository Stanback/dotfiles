# local.zsh.example
#
# This file is for machine-specific configuration that shouldn't be in your repo.
# Copy this to local.zsh (which is gitignored) and customize as needed.
#
# Example uses:
# - Machine-specific PATH additions
# - Work vs personal machine differences
# - Experimental aliases you're testing
# - Local proxy settings
# - Custom PS1 tweaks

# Example: Load work-specific config on work machine
# if [[ "$(hostname)" == "work-laptop.local" ]]; then
#   export WORK_MODE=true
#   alias kubectl="kubectl --context=work-cluster"
# fi

# Example: Add local bin directory
# export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
